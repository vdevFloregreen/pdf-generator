Development of V4 started in December last year, and it's been about 3 months since then.

I apologize for the slow development speed. However, the release of V4 is gradually becoming a reality.

## Features Planned for V4

1. [**Add DynamicTable Schema #332**](https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues/332)

    ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/3d22843b2486-20240302.png)
    
    - The table is being implemented differently than planned.
        - Two months ago, I wrote a blog post titled [Implementation Ideas for Dynamic Tables in pdfme](https://pdfme.com/blog/implementation-Ideas-for-dynamic-tables), but the actual implementation deviated from the ideas at that time.
        - The implementation is based on **[jspdf-autotable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jspdf-autotable)**.
            - It was thought that organized classes, options, and layout calculations could be reused.
            - The code from **[jspdf-autotable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jspdf-autotable)** was ported, unnecessary code was removed, and it's being used for table calculation processes.
        - In both the generator and UI packages, the `getDynamicTemplate` function is called to calculate the height of the table, readjust the Y-coordinate of schemas located below the table, and handle page breaks.
    - There are several critical bugs that have not been successfully fixed for a week.
        - The implementation of `getDynamicTemplate` is failing to calculate correctly, which is critical and blocking the release.
            - [ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ [Form & Generator] The page break does not account for pages beyond the second page. #429](https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues/429)
            - [ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ [Form & Generator] When spanning across pages, it overlaps due to a padding issue. #428](https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues/428)
        - Bugs are already documented in issues: https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atable
        - Honestly, I'm stuck on fixing these bugs. I don't want to be stuck here, so I plan to start working on the other features introduced next.
2. [**Add a Left Sidebar for Placing Schemas #400**](https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues/400)
    
    ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/be31a9c03519-20240302.png)

    - Adding a UI that allows dragging schemas from the sidebar.
    - The definition of plugins is changing (adding icons), so I intend to include this in this major version.
3. [**Placeholder, Expression #439**](https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues/439)
    
    ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/4e66257d5d55-20240302.png)

    - I don't have a concrete image of how to realize this yet.
        - Perhaps a template engine like **[Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/)** could operate at render time?
    - However, there is a clear need from users. This might also involve breaking changes, so it might be included in V4 depending on circumstances.

## Release Timing

- I want to release as soon as possible, but I can't determine a release date yet since I don't know when the bugs will be fixed, and I haven't started on the other features.
- Currently, only the implementation of the table is completed, and there are still critical bugs to be resolved before release, so it looks like it will take some more time.
- If you don't particularly plan to use the features announced in V4, please continue to use V3 with confidence. Necessary fixes for V3, including bug support, will continue.

## Access to the alpha version

- A preview environment for V4 is prepared: https://pdfme-playground-v4.vercel.app/
- How to install V4
    
    Versions tagged with next on [npm's version page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pdfme/generator?activeTab=versions) are V4 versions. Currently, version 4.0.0-alpha.0 is released for each package.
    
    ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/65a828e2f2b7-20240302.png)

    - The following command can be used for installation:
        - `npm i @pdfme/common@4.0.0-alpha.0 @pdfme/schemas@4.0.0-alpha.0 @pdfme/generator@4.0.0-alpha.0 @pdfme/ui@4.0.0-alpha.0`

## About Backward Compatibility

When using V4, modifications will be necessary for past templates and plugins.

- Templates:
    - `template.sampledata` has been deprecated, and now designer display data is held in each schema's `content` property.
        - Modification example: https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/pull/427/files#diff-4f370f85245caa3e9aa10fa5ecded75ba9fca1530600f8ceadc8b94f01f7df77
- Plugins:
    - Plugins now use `defaultSchema.content` instead of `defaultValue` as initial data.
        
        ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/2cb01519cb4a-20240302.png)
        
    - When onChange occurs within a plugin, instead of rewriting the user input with `onChange`, it is now possible to also change the schema definition itself in the format `{[key:string]:string}`. If you want to reflect the user input as before, please write `onChange({ key: 'content', value: data });`.
        
        ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/02a5e41c6fb9-20240302.png)
        
    - Modification example: https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/pull/427/files#diff-e64985c2bcbfd91c01ab897562721dccc7605499f81432b2e09c167e7a844bb0
- Versioning Templates:
    - Templates created with the V4 designer will now have versions. Currently, as it is in development, the property `pdfmeVersion:"4-dev"` will be added.

## Finally

### Help wanted!

I can move to the next step if the table bug is resolved, but honestly, I'm stuck and would really appreciate help...

- If anyone is willing to help with the following issue, please let me know. I intend to add the information I know to the issue so that we can fix it efficiently when a collaborator appears.
    - [ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ [Form & Generator] The page break does not account for pages beyond the second page. #429](https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues/429)
    - [ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ [Form & Generator] When spanning across pages, it overlaps due to a padding issue. #428](https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues/428)

I'm stuck but want to move forward, so I intend to start implementing the following feature in March.

- [**Add a Left Sidebar for Placing Schemas #400**](https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues/400)

### Thanks, everyone

I couldn't make good progress in February, but the contributors did an excellent job. Thank you.

- [Fix pdf text render overlap by avoiding line breaks in pdflib #417](https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/pull/417)
- [ui-build-optimization: development react/react-dom files in prod build fix #422](https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/pull/422)

It's not merged yet, but this PR that added color type is cool too.

- [Added support for color type option in generator #436](https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/pull/436)

There are infinite ways to contribute to OSS beyond code.

First, use the software, and if you think it's good, introduce this library to your friends. If you find a bug, please register it from [GitHub issues](https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues).

It might take some time, but I try to reply as much as possible and look through the comments.

V4 will include the table feature I had given up on when I started creating this library, and this was something I could never have done alone. I am grateful to supporters, contributors, and users. I am amazed by the power of OSS, and now I feel like we can create the best PDF library!

I will update you if there are any more updates. Thanks for reading to the end.
